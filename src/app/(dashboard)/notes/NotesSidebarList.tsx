 * discard already reads as movement because the collapsing row's height carries
 * everything below it along; a re-sort changes no heights at all, so without
 * this the rows simply swap between two frames.
 *
 * FLIP: after the DOM has the new order but before the browser paints it, put
 * each moved row back where it was with a transform, then release it. The
 * browser animates the release, so the row appears to travel from its old
 * position even though it was never actually there.
 *
 * `offsetTop`, not `getBoundingClientRect`: the list scrolls, and a viewport
 * measurement would read a scroll between renders as a move and animate every
 * row at once.
 *
 * Runs on a re-sort and nothing else. Rows also move when one is added or
 * discarded, but those already animate their own height and the rows below ride
 * that for free — FLIPping them too would drag them back to where they started
 * and play the same journey a second time, which is the jiggle this guards
 * against. Three conditions have to hold, and each rules out one way of moving
 * that isn't a re-sort:
 *
 * - the order of ids changed — a collapse or an expand leaves it identical;
 * - the *set* of ids didn't — an add or a removal is not a re-sort;
 * - nothing is mid-discard — a measurement taken while a row is collapsing is a
 *   position that no longer means anything by the time it is compared against.
 *
 * Limit worth knowing: a row moving *between* date groups is clipped on the way
 * by its new group's `overflow-hidden` (which the collapse animation needs), so
 * it slides in from that group's edge rather than all the way from where it was.
 * Within a group — which is where re-sorting almost always happens, since both
 * the edit and the group are "Today" — nothing is clipped.

/**
 * Two-tier selection, the way a native master/detail list behaves: the selected

 * active pane, and thins to a 6% wash of that same accent once focus moves to
 * the search box or the note body. The row keeps the same size and shape either
 * way and stays recognisably blue — only the strength drops, so it still reads
 * as "this is the open note" without competing with whatever you're actually
 * typing in.
 *
 * Three levels that don't get confused for each other: neutral hover
 * (`--bg-default-secondary`) < inactive selection (`--primary-action-light`) <
 * active selection (`--primary-action`).
 *
 * Driven entirely by `group-focus-within/list` on the scroll container, so there
 * is no focus bookkeeping in state — and no focusin/focusout flicker when
 * tabbing from one row to the next. Every class here only ever lands on the
 * selected row.
 *
 * Two cascade traps here, both from `@sarunyu/system-one/styles.css` being
 * imported *after* `globals.css` in the root layout:
 *
 * 1. *Both* fills go through `var(...)` rather than the `bg-primary-action` /
 *    `bg-primary-action-light` classes the rest of the app uses. Those are
 *    hand-written in the design system's stylesheet, not Tailwind utilities:
 *    Tailwind can't build a `group-focus-within` variant of one, and using the
 *    other as the base would let it beat the variant on the tie described in
 *    (2) — the faint wash would win and the row would never go solid. The
 *    variables are on `:root` and redefined under `.dark`, so this stays
 *    theme-aware.
 * 2. The text overrides are forced with `!`. The design system also ships plain
 *    `.text-foreground` / `.text-muted-foreground` classes — same 0-1-0
 *    specificity as a Tailwind variant, but later in the cascade, so they win
 *    the tie and the text stays dark-on-accent. `!` is what makes the override
 *    independent of stylesheet order.
