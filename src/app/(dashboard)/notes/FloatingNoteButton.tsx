 * Persistent "New note" button, bottom-right on every dashboard page. On a
 * client's Full Profile the note it creates is filed under that client, so a
 * thought captured while looking at someone lands on them without being asked.
 *
 * The composer opens as a panel beside the button rather than a dialog over the
 * page: what you were looking at when you thought of the note stays visible
 * while you write it.
 *
 * The draft lives *here*, not in the composer, and that is the whole point. A
 * popover dismisses on any stray click outside, and the composer is unmounted
 * when it does — so a half-written note held inside it would be gone. Holding it
 * at this level means dismissing the panel costs nothing: the button marks that
 * something is unfinished, and reopening picks up mid-sentence. Discarding is
 * then something you choose, in the composer, rather than something a misclick
 * does to you.
