          steps it up one — `--primary-action-muted` is the same hue at 10%
          against the resting 6%.

          `select-none` because this is a button, not a passage to select.

          `aspect-[4/3]` — landscape, so the wall stays scannable at a glance
          instead of every row being tall enough to read. A fixed ratio rather
          than content height is what keeps rows even: note bodies are any
          length, so their height can't come from what's in them. */}
      {/* Hover lifts the card off the wall — accent border, a shadow and a 2px
          rise. The border alone was too quiet to tell you a card was a target
          at all, and on a grid of similar rectangles the shadow is what reads
          fastest.

          Hover border goes through `var(...)`, not the `border-primary-action`
          class the add tile uses: that one is hand-written in the design
          system's stylesheet rather than being a Tailwind utility, so Tailwind
          can't build a `group-hover` variant of it and the rule was never
          emitted at all. Bare, the class is fine — it's only variants of it that
          silently do nothing.

          `motion-reduce:` drops the movement and keeps the colour and shadow,
          which carry the same message without anything sliding.

          The open card gets a ring rather than just the accent border: hover is
          transient and this isn't, so they need to be told apart when the
          pointer happens to be resting on the open one. */}

      {/* Title, then the reminder — and nothing else.

          The written-on date used to lead this line, and it was saying what the
          group header two rows up had already said: every card under "Today"
          was stamped with today's date. Between that and spelling out
          "Reminder ·" the line ran past the width of a card on a phone and
          wrapped, which is what threw the rows out of line with each other.

          What's left is only the part the wall can't otherwise tell you: that
          this note comes due, and when. The bell says which of the two dates
          this is, so the word doesn't have to.

          On a phone the title goes too, for the same reason the date did: the
          card right above it is already showing it, and at two columns there
          isn't room to say anything twice. The card's copy is the truncated
          one, so nothing is lost by keeping that one and dropping this. From
          `md` up the wall is three or four columns of smaller cards and the
          caption is what you read along, so it stays.

          With no reminder there is then nothing left to caption, and the block
          has to go rather than sit there as an empty row of `gap-2` under the
          card. Driven off `reminder` rather than a media-query hook: the
          stylesheet knows the width before first paint, and a hook would only
          learn it after hydration — one frame of captions appearing and
          vanishing across the whole wall. */}
