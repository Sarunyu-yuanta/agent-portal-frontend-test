/**
 * The pill that reads out a note's client and reminder, and opens the fields for
 * changing them.
 *
 * Shared by the quick-note composer and the detail pane so the two are the same
 * control rather than two that happen to look alike. The `open` state is the
 * caller's: the composer needs to know when this is up so its own Escape
 * handling can defer to it.
 *
 * Nesting this popover inside another one works — Radix guards
 * `onPointerDownOutside` with a flag set from `onPointerDownCapture`, and React's
 * synthetic events propagate through the React tree, portals included. This
 * content is a React child of whatever opened it, so a click in here counts as
 * "inside" that layer and it stays open. `modal` is false by default too, so
 * there are no duelling focus traps.
