 * stack, which answers "roughly who" in the space of three circles; the point of
 * opening the alert is to get from "roughly who" to a list you can work down.
 *
 * Two states, not two surfaces: the list, and one holder's contact details
 * (`HolderContact`). Both live in whatever shell the caller opened — a modal on
 * a pointer device, a sheet on a phone — so Back returns to the alert rather
 * than to the page.
 *
 * Names go through `maskName`, the way every other client name in the app does
 * when privacy mode is on. A list of full names is a much louder leak than the
 * initials on an avatar, so this is the one place in the Calendar where the
 * setting has to be honoured.
