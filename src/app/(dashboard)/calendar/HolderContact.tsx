          `overflow-hidden` is what rounds the first and last row's hover fill
          along with the border.

          `max-h` rather than `flex-1`: this pane sits in a sliding track whose
          height is measured and animated (see `AlertDetail`), and a pane that
          stretches to fill has no height of its own to measure. Three contact
