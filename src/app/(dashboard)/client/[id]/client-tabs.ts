 * against it, and the loading skeleton draws a placeholder per entry. So a tab
 * that's out of the current delivery phase (see `lib/feature-flags`) leaves the
 * strip, stops being addressable by URL, and stops being drawn as a bar the
 * page then never fills in — all from the same edit.
 *
 * Its own module rather than living in `page.tsx`, only because the skeleton is
 * imported *by* `page.tsx` and would otherwise have to import back out of it.
