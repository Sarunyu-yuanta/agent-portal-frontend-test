 * backend raised that name this client. Until now those two only met on the
 * Calendar, where finding one client's meant reading every day of the month.
 *
 * A note row opens `NoteEditModal` in place — the same editor `CalendarView`
 * opens its own note rows into — rather than hopping to the Notes tab, so
 * triaging reminders doesn't cost the place you were reading them from. An
 * alert row opens the read-only panel, since there is nothing on it for the
 * desk to edit.
 *
 * Two shapes off the same data: the desktop table keeps the bucket grouping
 * above (`rows`), each row still saying its own Overdue/Today/Upcoming/Done.
 * The card lists (mobile, and the Client Hub's compact dialog) are grouped by
 * calendar day instead (`daySections`) — a header per day rather than per
 * status, with Today pinned first and shown even when it's empty, so opening
 * the tab always answers "what's today" before anything else. Any other day
 * only appears because it already has something under it.
