/**
 * The header bell's KYC rows — one per client whose KYC has lapsed or is close
 * enough to have rung a checkpoint, tagged with the zone its *expiry* falls in.
 *
 * Placed by deadline, not by the day the checkpoint fired. The feed used to do
 * the latter, on the reasoning that a notification list is read newest-first
 * and the heading should answer "when did this arrive". That holds for news;
 * "KYC จะหมดอายุในอีก 1 วัน" is a deadline, and the thing an RM decides from is
 * how long is left — so it now shares one axis with the reminder feed, which
 * also lets the two merge into a single ordered list instead of being
 * concatenated. See `./notification-zones`.
 *
 * Countdowns come from {@link kycExpiry}, which derives them from `nextReview`,
 * rather than from `getKycDueClients`, which reads the record's stored
 * `daysUntilExpiry` — the bell has to say the same number as the countdown pill
 * on the client's own profile, and only one of those two is still right once a
 * stored count has been sitting in a file for a month.
 *
 * A record whose `nextReview` can't be parsed raises nothing: there is no
 * countdown to place it by, and guessing which day it fired is worse than
 * staying quiet. It still shows as a date on the client's own KYC tab.
