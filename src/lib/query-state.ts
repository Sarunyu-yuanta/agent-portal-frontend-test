/**
 * Helpers for keeping view state — category tab, filter chip, open panel, sub-tab
 * — in the query string instead of in component state that dies on unmount.
 *
 * These use the native History API rather than `router.push/replace`. Every
 * param involved is read on the client through `useSearchParams`, so a router
 * navigation would buy a pointless RSC round-trip (and a scroll reset) for a
 * change the server has no opinion about. Next patches `pushState` /
 * `replaceState` into its router, so `usePathname` / `useSearchParams` stay in
 * sync and browser back/forward keep working.
