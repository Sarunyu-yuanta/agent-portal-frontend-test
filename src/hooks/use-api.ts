 * The app's data-access seam.
 *
 * ─── Backend handoff ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing here talks to a network today. Every dataset is JSON that ships in the
 * bundle (`src/data/*.json`, assembled in `@/lib/mock-data`), so each hook below
 * hands it straight back through {@link useStatic}.
 *
 * What the indirection buys is the swap: screens consume a {@link Resource},
 * never a bare array, and they already render skeletons against its
 * `isLoading`. Giving a dataset a real endpoint is a change *here* — see
 * {@link useStatic} for the diff — and the loading states light up on their own.
 *
 * The Product Catalog and Insights datasets have their own module,
 * `@/hooks/use-catalog`. This file holds the ones the dashboard shell needs.

 * - }
 * + export function useClientsResource() {
 * +   const fetcher = useCallback(() => fetchClients(), []);
 * +   return useResource("useClients", fetcher, mockClients);
 * + }
 * ```
 *
 * The moment that swap happens `isLoading` starts going `true` on the first
 * render and the skeleton already wired to it appears — no component edited, no
 * switch to remember to flip. That is the whole reason this returns a resource
 * instead of the bare value: it costs one line of indirection now and saves
 * having to re-plumb every screen later.
