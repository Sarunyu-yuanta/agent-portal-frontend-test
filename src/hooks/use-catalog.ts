/**
 * Resource hooks for the Product Catalog and Insights screens.
 *
 * ─── Backend handoff: this is the only file you need to touch ────────────────
 * Every screen below reads its data as a `Resource<T>` — `{ data, isLoading }`
 * — and already renders a skeleton while `isLoading` is true. Today each hook
 * resolves from the bundled mock data via `useStatic`, so `isLoading` is
 * `false` and the pages paint instantly.
 *
 * To put one of these on a real endpoint, change that hook's body:
 *
 * ```diff
 * - export function useTopIdeas() {
 * -   return useStatic(ALL_TOP_IDEAS);
 * - }
 * + export function useTopIdeas() {
 * +   const fetcher = useCallback(() => fetchTopIdeas(), []);
 * +   return useResource("useTopIdeas", fetcher, ALL_TOP_IDEAS);
 * + }
 * ```
 *
 * The skeleton then starts appearing on its own, for exactly as long as the
 * request actually takes. No component changes, and nothing to switch on — the
 * loading state is a property of the data, so it follows the data.
 *
 * `useResource` also keeps the behaviour you want for a polled resource:
 * `isLoading` is true only until the *first* attempt settles, so background
 * refreshes swap data in without flashing the skeleton again.
 *
 * Keeping the mock value as `useResource`'s third argument is worth doing — it
 * is the fallback when a request fails, so a dead endpoint degrades to the
 * current behaviour instead of an empty screen.
 *
 * The lookup helpers these wrap (`findProductById`, `getGlobalBondIssuer`, …)
 * stay where they are. They are what a route resolver becomes once the real
 * endpoint is per-id rather than a whole collection.

 * own its own skeleton, and for this aggregate to be deleted — one spinner over
