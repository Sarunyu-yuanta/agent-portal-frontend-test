 * talk to was a mock route backed by an in-process store, so it never outlived
 * the dev server either; the one thing lost by dropping it is that notes no
 * longer survive a page reload. Everything asynchronous went with it — the
 * optimistic insert, the local-id→server-id map, and the create-then-edit race
 * they existed to paper over are all gone, because a write is now just a
 * `setNotes`.
 *
 * The mutators stay `async`. They are awaited at every call site, and keeping
 * the signature means this can go back to a real endpoint without touching a
